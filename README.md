## Overview
Project objective for this challenge is to build out this Rest countries api with color theme switcher and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I am required to use the React + TypeScript front-end framework. However, I have complete control over which packages to use to do things like make HTTP requests or style the project.

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the colour scheme between light and dark mode
